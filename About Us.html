    </h1>


<p>
    Founded in 1998 by the talented baker John Thompson, John's Bakery began as a small local store in a busy neighbourhood.
     John spent his life building meals that combined standard <br>techniques with creative flavours in order to achieve his dream of feeding the locals with fresh,<br> fresh-baked bread and cookies, pastries along with coffee. 
     His famous bread quickly grew fame and attracted both loyal clients and hungry newcomers.

      These days, John's Bakery is about more than just goods; it's about community, <br>acting as a place where people can enjoy delicious food and make lifelong memories!
